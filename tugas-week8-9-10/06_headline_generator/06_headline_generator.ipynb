For our example, we'll use text sentences. Language is naturally composed of sequence data, in the form of characters in words, and words in sentences. Other examples of sequence data include stock prices and  weather data over time. Videos, while containing still images, are also sequences. Elements in the data have a relationship with what comes before and what comes after, and this fact requires a different approach."

We can notice that most of the headlines make some kind of grammatical sense, but don't necessarily indicate a good contextual understanding.  The results might improve somewhat by running more epochs. You can do this by runnning the training `fit` cell again (and again!) to train another 30 epochs each time.  You should see the loss value go down.  Then try the tests again.  Results can vary quite a bit!\n",
